# PowerBI-Dashboard
Hello!

I'm excited to share my first Power BI project. an interactive dashboard to analyse Super Store sales. This dashboard is a great way to track your sales performance and make informed business decisions.

I used complex parameters to drill down into worksheets and customize the dashboard with filters and slicers.

Here are the tasks I performed:

-Transformed data using Power Query.

-Used different types of customized visualizations such as bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicer, etc.
